  - DialogContent: Woah! What is this place? That smell?
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 5e07a4ebe4e753f4e91e343812c4f2f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: You have been scrubbing down an entire mansion, yet only now does
      your nose take offense?
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d0d5b1227bb2144aa494262bca395f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: I can deal with rut and mold, even LIVE furniture apparently.
      But this? A new level of nasty.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 5e07a4ebe4e753f4e91e343812c4f2f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: "Would you kindly refrain from criticizing my work in progress?
      My current\u2026 condition and these hands make following a potion brewing
      guide divided on two sticky pages challenging."
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d0d5b1227bb2144aa494262bca395f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: A potion? Like witchy cauldron vibes?
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 5e07a4ebe4e753f4e91e343812c4f2f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: No! Or yes. The potion is meant to restore myself and my home
      to our former glory.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d0d5b1227bb2144aa494262bca395f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: Hold on a sec. But you said you were a realtor! You own the house?!
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 5e07a4ebe4e753f4e91e343812c4f2f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: Hopefully not for long! I hope to convince people to buy the mansion
      by enhancing its appeal with a touch of magic.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d0d5b1227bb2144aa494262bca395f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: You turned the furniture into that? And yourself into that thing.
      Why?
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 5e07a4ebe4e753f4e91e343812c4f2f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: I didn't mean to. Not myself anyways. Come on now. Help me undo
      it by turning the page in this book so I can complete the potion and you can
      leave with a bag full of your well-earned payment. But be careful! The pages
      are delicate.
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d0d5b1227bb2144aa494262bca395f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: But you meant to do it to the furniture?
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 5e07a4ebe4e753f4e91e343812c4f2f2, type: 2}
  - DialogContent: Just stop blabbering and help me, would you?
    Speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 0d0d5b1227bb2144aa494262bca395f2, type: 2}
